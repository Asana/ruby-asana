    # A _project_ represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana. It exists in a
    # single workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in
    # that workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.
    #
    # Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. You cannot currently
    # change the team of a project via the API. Non-organization workspaces do not
    # have teams and so you should not specify the team of project in a
    # regular workspace.
